<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This lab will guide you through writing a basic paravirtual 
hypervisor.
We will use the bochs x86 emulator, which has support
for Intel's VT-x hardware support.
The main topics this lab will cover are:
bootstrapping a guest OS, programming extended page tables,
emulating privileged instructions, and using hypercalls to implement
hard drive emulation over a disk image file.

</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<pre>
1) First add the PATH for bochs:<br />
    a) Open ~/.bash_profile : <b>vi ~/.bash_profile</b><br />
    b) Add the line <b>PATH=$PATH:/bochs/bin</b> to <b>~/.bash_profile</b>

2) Now use <b>bochs</b> instead of <b>qemu</b> to load and run obj/kern/kernel.img
    a) jos@csjaws$ <kbd>cd lab</kbd>
    b) jos@csjaws$ <kbd>make</kbd>
    c) jos@csjaws$ <kbd>make bochs-nox</kbd>

</pre>

<h2>Part 1: VMM Bootstrap </h2>

<p>The JOS VMM is launched by a fairly simple program in <tt>user/vmm.c</tt>.
This application calls a new system call to create an environment (similar to a process)
that runs in guest mode instead of ring 3 (<tt>sys_env_mkguest</tt>).
</p>

<p>Once the guest is created, the VMM then copies the bootloader and kernel
into the guest's physical address space,  marks the environment as runnable,
and waits until the guest exits.
</p>

<p>
You will need to implement key pieces of the supporting system calls
for the VMM, as well as some of the copying functionality.</p>

<p>You can try running the vmm from the shell in your guest by typing:</p>
<pre>
$ vmm
</pre>
<p>This will currently panic the kernel because the code to detect
vmx and extended page table support is not implemented, but
as you complete the lab, you will see this launch a JOS-in-JOS environment.</p>

<h3>Making a guest environment</h3>

<p>The JOS bookkeeping for <tt>sys_env_mkguest</tt> is already provided for you
in <tt>kern/syscall.c</tt>.  Especially if you did not work the JOS labs,
you may wish to skim this code, as well as the code in <tt>kern/env.c</tt> to understand
how environments are managed.  A major difference between a guest and a regular environment
is that a guest has its type set to <tt>ENV_TYPE_GUEST</tt> as well as a <tt>VmxGuestInfo</tt> structureand a <tt>vmcs</tt> structure associated with it.
</p>

<p>The <tt>vmm</tt> directory includes the kernel-level support needed for 
the VMM---primarily extended page table support.</p>

<p>Your first task will be to implement detection that the CPU supports vmx and extended paging.
do this by checking the output of the <tt>cpuid</tt> instruction 
and reading the values in certain model specific registers (MSRs).
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Read Chapters 23.6, 24.6.2, and  Appendices A.3.2-3 from the <a href="ref/vmx/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf">Intel manual</a> to 
learn how to discover if the CPU supports vmx and extended paging.
</p>
<p>Once you have read these sections, implement the <tt>vmx_check_support()</tt>
and <tt>vmx_check_ept()</tt> functions in <tt>vmm/vmx.c</tt>.  You will also need to add support to <tt>sched_yield()</tt> to call <tt>vmxon()</tt> when launcing a guest environment.
</p>
<p>If these functions are properly implemented, an attempt to start the VMM
will not panic the kernel, but will fail because the vmm can't map 
guest bootloader and kernel into the VM.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Mapping in the guest bootloder and kernel</h3>

<p>In <tt>user/vmm.c</tt> we have provided the structure of the code to 
set up the guest and bootloader.  However, you must implement the
memory manipulation code to copy the guest kernel and bootloader 
into the VM.</p>

<p>Like any other user application in JOS, the vmm has the ability to open files, read pages,
and map pages into other
environments via IPC.  One difference is that we've added a new system call <tt>sys_ept_map</tt>,
which you must implement.  The high-level difference between <tt>sys_ept_map</tt> and <tt>sys_page_map</tt>
is whether the page is added using extended page tables or regular page tables.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Skim Chapter 28.2 of the <a href="ref/vmx/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf">Intel manual</a> to 
familiarize yourself with low-level EPT programming.  Several helpful definitions have been provided
in <tt>vmm/ept.h</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Implement <tt>sys_ept_map</tt> in <tt>kern/syscall.c</tt>, as well as
<tt>ept_lookup_gpa</tt> and <tt>ept_map_hva2gpa</tt> in <tt>vmm/ept.c</tt>.
Once this is complete, you should have complete support for nested paging.
</p>
<p>Note: you will need to write your own test cases for these functions
to verify that they work properly.</p>
</div>

<p>
At this point, you have enough host-level support function to map the guest bootloader
and kernel into the guest VM.
You will need to read the kernel's ELF headers and copy the segments into the guest.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Implement <tt>copy_guest_kern_gpa()</tt> and <tt>map_in_guest()</tt> in <tt>user/vmm.c</tt>.
For the bootloader, we use <tt>map_in_guest</tt> directly, since the bootloader is only 512 bytes,
whereas the kernel's ELF header must be read by <tt>copy_guest_kern_gpa</tt>, which should then call
<tt>map_in_guest</tt> for each segment.
</p>
<p>Once this is complete, the kernel will attempt to run the guest, and will panic because <tt>asm_vmrun</tt> is incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge</span> (20 bonus points, or part of the final project)
One way this VMM paravirtualizes JOS is to map the kernel into the guest and use a simpler, modified bootloader.
Replace our modified bootloader in <tt>vmm/jos_boot.S</tt> with the unmodified bootloader in
<tt>boot/boot.S</tt>, and eliminate the need to map the kernel for the guest in the VMM.
</p>
<p>This will require trapping accesses to the I/O ports to detect disk reads, and possibly trapping other operations.</p>
</div>

<h3>Implementing vmlaunch and vmresume.</h3>

<p>
In this exercise, you will need to write some assembly to launch the VM.
Although much of the VMCS setup is completed for you, this exercise will
require you to use the <tt>vmwrite</tt> instruction to set the host stack pointer,
as well as the <tt>vmlaunch</tt> and <tt>vmresume</tt> instructions to
start the VM.
</p>

<p>
In order to facilitate interaction between the guest and the JOS host kernel,
we copy the guest register state into the environment's Trapframe structure.
Thus, you will also write assembly to copy the relevant guest registers to and 
from this trapframe struct.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
Skim Chapter 26 of the <a href="ref/vmx/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf">Intel manual</a> to 
familiarize yourself with the vmlaunch and vmresume instructions. 
Complete the assembly code in <tt>asm_vmrun</tt> in <tt>vmm/vmx.c</tt>.
</p>
<p>Once this is complete, you should be able to run the VM until the guest attempts a <tt>vmcall</tt> instruction, which traps to the host kernel.
Because the host isn't handling traps from the guest yet, the VM will be terminated.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Part 2: Handling VM exits</h2>

<p>
The equivalent event to a trap from an application to the operating system is called a VM <i>exit</i>.
We have provided some skeleton code to dispatch the major types of exits we expect our guest to provide in the <tt>vmm/vmx.c</tt> function <tt>vmexit()</tt>.
You will need to identify the reason for the exit from the VMCS, as well as implement handler functions for certain events in 
<tt>vmm/vmexits.c</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Similar to issuing a system call (e.g., using the <tt>int</tt> or <tt>syscall</tt> instruction),
a guest can programmatically trap to the host using the <tt>vmcall</tt> instruction (sometimes called hypercalls).
The current JOS guest uses three hypercalls: one to read the e820 map, which specifies the 
physical memory layout to the OS; and two to use host-level IPC, discussed below.</p>

<h3>Multi-boot map (aka e820)</h3>

<p>
    JOS is "told" the amount of physical memory it has by the
    bootloader. JOS's bootloader passes the kernel a multiboot info
    structure which possibly contains the physical memory map of the
    system. The memory map may exclude regions of memory that are in use
    for reasons including IO mappings for devices (e.g., the "memory hole"), space
    reserved for the BIOS, or physically damaged memory.
    For more details on how this structure looks and what it
    contains, refer to the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html">specification</a>. A
    typical physical memory map for a PC with 10 GB of memory looks
    like below.

    <pre>
        e820 MEMORY MAP
            address: 0x0000000000000000, length: 0x000000000009f400, type: USABLE
            address: 0x000000000009f400, length: 0x0000000000000c00, type: RESERVED
            address: 0x00000000000f0000, length: 0x0000000000010000, type: RESERVED
            address: 0x0000000000100000, length: 0x00000000dfefd000, type: USABLE
            address: 0x00000000dfffd000, length: 0x0000000000003000, type: RESERVED
            address: 0x00000000fffc0000, length: 0x0000000000040000, type: RESERVED
            address: 0x0000000100000000, length: 0x00000001a0000000, type: USABLE
    </pre>
</p>

<p>For the JOS guest, rather than emulate a BIOS, we will simply use a vmcall
to request a "fake" memory map.  Complete emulation of this feature
would be an excellent bonus task, or part of a final project.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Complete the implementation of <tt>vmexit()</tt> by identifying the reason for the exit from
the VMCS.  You may need to search Chapter 27 of the 
<a href="ref/vmx/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf">Intel manual</a> to 
solve this part of the exercise.
</p>
<p>
Implement the <tt>VMX_VMCALL_MBMAP</tt> case of the function <tt>handle_vmcall()</tt> in <tt>vmm/vmexits.c</tt>.
Also, be sure to advance the instruction pointer so that the guest doesn't get in an infinite loop.
</p>
</div>

<p>Once the guest gets a little further in boot, it will attempt to discover whether the 
CPU supports long mode, using the <tt>cpuid</tt> instruction.
Our VMCS is configured to trap on this instruction, so that we can emulate it---hiding the 
presence of vmx, since we have not implemented emulation of vmx in software.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
Once this is complete, implement <tt>handle_cpuid()</tt> in <tt>vmm/vmexits.c</tt>.
</p>
<p>
When the host can emulate the <tt>cpuid</tt> instruction, your guest should run until it 
attempts to perform disk I/O.
</p>
</div>

<p>Recall that JOS has a user-level file system server daemon, similar to a microkernel.
We place the guest's disk image as a file on the host file system server.
When the guest file system daemon requests disk reads, rather than issuing ide-level commands, we will instead
use vmcalls to ask the host file system daemon for regions of the disk image file.
This is depicted in the image below.</p>

<img src="disk-architecture.jpg"/>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Modify <tt>bc_pgfault</tt> amd <tt>flush_block</tt> in <tt>fs/bc.c</tt> to issue 
I/O requests using the <tt>host_read</tt> and <tt>host_write</tt> hypercalls.
Use the macro <tt>VMM_GUEST</tt> to select different behavior for the guest and host OS.
</p>
<p>
Once this is complete, you will need to implement the IPC send and receive hypercalls in <tt>handle_vmcall</tt>,
as well as the client code to issue <tt>ipc_host_send</tt> and <tt>ipc_host_recv</tt> vmcalls in <tt>lib/ipc.c></tt>.
</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to extend the <tt>sys_ipc_try_send</tt> and <tt>sys_ipc_recv</tt> calls to 
detect whether the environment is of type <tt>ENV_TYPE_GUEST</tt> or not, and replace the pmap functions with ept calls.
You will also need to implement the <tt>ept_page_insert</tt> function.
</div>

<p>
Once these steps are complete, you should have a fully running JOS-on-JOS.</p>
