    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      In this lab you will do an open-ended final project.      
    </p>

    <h2>Lab Requirements</h2>

    <!--<p>

     Here is a list of possible tasks for a final project.  Some are small enough
     that multiple options should be combined, especially if you have a larger group.
     You are most welcome to come up with other ideas.
     The actual project is up to you. Please pick
     something manageable. It is far better to complete your project to spec
     than it is to take on something too big and not have anything to show
     for it except excellent intentions (also true in the real world).
    </p>

      <ul>
		<li>The JOS VMM currently only runs on one CPU.  Incorportate SMP support (some code already in 
		JOS baseline repository).</li>

		<li>Port the JOS VMM to work on AMD SVM (the rough equivalent of Intel's VMX).</li>

		<li>Implement support for an IOMMU to allow the guest to directly access hardware.</li>

		<li>Incorporate APICv support into JOS VMM</li>

		<li>Use a binary translator, like QEMU, to support trap-and-emulate
		semantics on an x86 CPU without VMX or SVM support.</li>

		<li>Port the JOS network driver (from lab6) to work on the JOS VMM</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The work of students that do a particularly good project may be incorporated
      into future assignments (a good way to get your name on the credits page!).</p>

      <p>In the interest of making other useful research infrastructure, any non-trivial improvement to the lguest refernence implementation would also be a good course project, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for VMX or SVM</li>
      <li>Support for other architectures, including 64-bit x86 (I don't think this was ever completed)</li>	
      <li>Support for multi-processors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For those students interested in systems research,
      you are welcome to use a virtualization-relevant project 
      as your course project, or talk to me about 
      some 
      projects I am interested in.  If you think you might
      want to pursue one of these, please send me a quick email
      and we can discuss during office hours.</p>

      <p>
      The project you choose must have a significant virtualization
      component.  For example, you shouldn't simply port a user-level
      application that requires little or no kernel modification.  You
      should email a proposal to the instructor
      by the deadline given above. The proposal must include: 
      (1) The names of your group members; (2) What you want to do; and 
      (3) What you are expecting to present (a list of deliverables). Please 
      keep it short (no more than several paragraphs).
      </p>

    <p>
      This ends the lab.
    </p>
    -->
    <p>
      Congratulations on having completed all of the labs! We are
      looking forward to seeing your projects!  
    </p>
