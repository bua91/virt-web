<h2> Is any kind of collaboration permitted on the labs? </h2>

<!--<p>
You may work in teams of two or alone.  You may not change partners after 
the first lab without explicit permission of the instructor. 
Do not discuss code with anyone other than your partner and the course staff. 
The <a href="policies.html#dishonesty">collaboration policy</a> elaborates.
</p>

<p>Between Labs 3 and 4, we will give you a substantial amount of base
code to accelerate you through the rest of the JOS exercises.  We want
you to do the intial JOS labs to understand how this code is
implemented in a baseline operating system, to facilitate modifying
the code to work as a hypervisor.</p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>A crucial component of the course is the labs. You will implement
(the interesting pieces of) a real virtual machine monitor
that will boot and run on a
PC. 
We will do this by adding a hosted (Type 2) VMM, similar in some ways to VMware
workstation or KVM, to the JOS operating system.
JOS was developed at MIT and
has been used in courses at several other schools. </p>

<p>JOS is simpler than Linux and Windows, but it includes most key
operating systems abstractions, including a bootloader, memory
protection, memory relocation, multiprogramming, a rudimentary file
system, and a command shell.</p>

<p>JOS can be thought of as an <a
href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf">exokernel</a>, where the kernel
implements a minimal set of core functionality that safely exports
hardware resources to applications. These low-level kernel interfaces
may be inconvenient for user processes to use directly, so user
processes will make use of a "library operating system" (libos) to
abstract these low-level exported resources into more convenient
programming abstractions.</p>

<p>Compared to a traditional kernel design, an exokernel is fairly well suited
to hosting a hypervisor, as the system call API is fairly close
to the hardware, and there is already a fairly robust IPC mechanism.
</p>

<p>Each lab in the series enhances the functionality of your operating
system. Each lab builds on the previous one, so it is important that you
design, build, and test carefully at each step. Carelessness in early
labs will be costly down the road. There are not a lot of lines of
code to write on this project; take the time to understand each phase
before moving to the next one.</p>
